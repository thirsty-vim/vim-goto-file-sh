" USAGE: After editing this plugin, you can reload it on the fly with
"        https://github.com/landonb/vim-source-reloader#‚Ü©Ô∏è
" - Uncomment this `unlet` (or disable the `finish`) and hit <F9>.
"
 silent! unlet g:loaded_vim_goto_file_plugin_includeexpr_for_gf

if exists("g:loaded_vim_goto_file_plugin_includeexpr_for_gf") || &cp
  finish
endif

let g:loaded_vim_goto_file_plugin_includeexpr_for_gf = 1

" -------------------------------------------------------------------

" USAGE: Decide what file types you want this plugin to work on.
" - You can set this variable blank to work on all file types:
"     let g:vim_goto_file_filetypes = ''
"
" REFER: The `:help includeexpr` doc examples use `setlocal`, e.g.:
"   setlocal includeexpr=s:MyIncludeExpr()
" But if this is the only `includeexpr` you use, you can enable it
" globally without concern.
" - But if you use another `includeexpr` (e.g., you've got vim-npr
"   installed and wired to JS/TS files; or maybe you use vim-fugitive,
"   which sets includeexpr for the 'fugitive' file type), then you'll
"   want to use a filetype restriction here.

if !exists("g:vim_goto_file_filetypes")
