==============================================================================
1. About This Plugin			*vim_goto_file_sh_about*

This plugin enables the Vim |gf| command to resolve shell variable
paths, including those with alternative values.

For example, you could position the cursor over the following path
and press |gf|: >

  ${VIM_PACK:-${HOME}/.vim/pack}/thirsty-vim/start/vim-goto-file-sh/README.rst
<
and Vim would open the file at >

  ~/.vim/pack/thirsty-vim/start/vim-goto-file-sh/README.rst
<
Project page: https://github.com/thirsty-vim/vim-goto-file-sh

==============================================================================
2. Further Details			*vim_goto_file_sh_further_details*

The Vim |gf| command ("Edit the file whose name is under or after the cursor")
will resolve tilde and the HOME environ variable, but not other variables.

- E.g., |gf| works on these paths: >

  ~/.vim/pack/thirsty-vim/start/vim-goto-file-sh/README.rst
    
  "$HOME/.vim/pack/thirsty-vim/start/vim-goto-file-sh/README.rst"

  "${HOME}/.vim/pack/thirsty-vim/start/vim-goto-file-sh/README.rst"
<
- But Vim's built-in |gf| won't work on these paths: >

  "${VIM_PACK:-${HOME}/.vim/pack}/thirsty-vim/start/vim-goto-file-sh/README.rst"

  "${THIRSTY_VIM:-${VIM_PACK:-${HOME}/.vim/pack}/thirsty-vim/start}/vim-goto-file-sh/README.rst"
<
Fortunately, Vim provides the |includeexpr| hook for when |gf| comes
up empty — so we don't need to rewrite the |gf| function, we can just
add an |includeexpr| function.

==============================================================================
3. Setup				*vim_goto_file_sh_setup*

First, install this plugin (see the project `README.rst`).

Next, ensure that |isfname| is configured properly.

- To work on alternative shell variable values, e.g., if you want
  |gf| to resolve `${foo:-bar}` to `bar` if `$foo` is not defined in the
  environment, then you'll need to ensure that Vim includes colons
  when sussing filenames.

  - E.g., here's the author's |isfname| value (where 39 is the
    single quote character, and 48-57 are the characters '0'-'9'): >

  set isfname=@,48-57,/,.,:,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,=,{,},(,),!,39
<
==============================================================================
4. Configuration			*vim_goto_file_sh_configuration*

By default, this plugin will only change |includeexpr| for specific
file types (and it will not alert you if it clobbers an existing
|includeexpr|).

- Specifically, this plugin works on Bash and Shell file types,
  as well as reST, Markdown, and Text.

- You can use a global variable to add or remove file types.

  Here's the default value: >

  let g:vim_goto_file_filetypes = 'bash,sh,markdown,rst,txt'
<
- If you'd like a global |includeexpr| (e.g., `set includeexpr = ...`
  and not `set local includeexpr = ...`), you can set this value to
  the empty string, e.g.: >

  let g:vim_goto_file_filetypes = ''
<
==============================================================================
5. Caveats				*vim_goto_file_sh_caveats*

This plugin calls `eval('$<var>')` on the environment variables
to try to resolves matches. So it matters how you started Vim.

- If you've started Vim/gVim from a shell terminal, it'll resolve
  environments normally defined in your shell.

- But if you've started Vim/gVim some other way, e.g., if you started
  MacVim via Spotlight Search, then your Vim environment won't include
  the same environment variables that your shell normally has.

  - Just FYI, you might want to start Vim/gVim from your shell to
    get this most utility out of this plugin.
